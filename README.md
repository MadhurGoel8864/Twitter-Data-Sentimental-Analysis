# Twitter Sentiment Analysis ML Model Readme

## Overview
This repository contains code for a Twitter sentiment analysis machine learning model. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of tweet text and corresponding emotion labels (positive, negative, neutral). The model performs data cleaning tasks such as removing stopwords and punctuation before training. Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is used for training the model.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model contains tweet text along with their emotion labels (positive, negative, neutral). The dataset is not provided in this repository due to privacy concerns, but you can easily replace it with your own dataset following the same format.

## Preprocessing
Before training the model, the tweet text undergoes several preprocessing steps:
- Removal of stopwords: Commonly occurring words (e.g., "the", "is", "are") that do not contribute much to sentiment analysis are removed.
- Removal of punctuation: Punctuation marks are stripped from the tweet text.

## Model Training
The Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is employed to train the sentiment analysis model. This algorithm is suitable for text classification tasks like sentiment analysis.

## Usage
To use the sentiment analysis model:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Replace the dataset file path in the code with your dataset file path.
4. Run the code to train the model.
5. After training, you can use the trained model to predict sentiment on new tweet data.

## Dependencies
The model code requires the following dependencies:
- Python (>=3.6)
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- nltk
